## Stat 506 Project - Group 6 Ordinal Logistic Regression

### Question: Do people with higher carbohydrate intake feel more sleepy during the day?

### Data: 
Three data sets (Sleep Disorder, Demographics, Total Nutrients Intake First Day) are used in the analysis, retrieved from [NHANES 2015-2016](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/ContinuousNhanes/Default.aspx?BeginYear=2015).

### Note:
The Brant Test and Mtable command which both come from the Spost13_ado package in Stata fail to be installed on 12/11. 
It was successfully downloaded the day before on 12/10, so I screenshot the marginal effects table formatted by Mtable because it looks nicer than the command margins, dydx().
